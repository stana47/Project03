/*
 * The Truck class keeps track of the truck's location throughout the simulation, whether the truck is moving or not,
 * and the direction that the truck is facing. The Truck can be handled with an Address, double precision coordinates
 * x and y, or both; although the constructors only accept one form or the other. When direction is NONE, we know that
 * the truck is not moving.
