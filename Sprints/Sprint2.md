Project04 - Sprint 2

Due: Friday, March 22, at 11:59pm


Sprint 2 Goal: Create a simulation of the truck moving through the neighborhood and making stops at each order location.

Design (UML) and code(Java) programs that will: 

1. Add a randomly generated time that an order is placed to the address data being generated. Generate a file of 100 random addresses with random order times. Order time should be a random number of minutes from the last order time. The earliest order time is 10:00am. The latest order time is 7:00pm. 

2. Modify the priority queue to have the priority be order time.

3. Compute a route that the truck must follow to visit each random location in order of order time. Compute and output the length of the truck's route.

4. Display a simulation of the truck's movements in the neighborhood. Truck's initial location is the distribution center.

5. Make sure to update the requirements document, UML, and Sprint burndown chart. Standup meetings must be submitted daily.
